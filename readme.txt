== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I selected my main menu to replace it but it still shows up =

Use your browser's inspector to find out the id name or class names of the residual menu elements. Input them in the **Hide These Elements When Hamburger is Visible** setting in Hamburger's **General** panel in the Customizer and enter those selectors there.

If that fails, you can always add some custom CSS to hide those using plugins such as Jetpack.
